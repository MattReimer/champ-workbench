1. Choose "Unpack..." from the main Workbench menu.
2. Review the inputs in the window that appears.
   1. Ensure that the top level folder points to your CHaMP workspace.
   2. Turn off the hydraulic model result if you don't intend to use these files.
3. Click OK. The tool will search through your folder structure and unzip any files that match the search patterns.
   *Note that the files are unzipped into the same folder as the zip archives. Specifying a different location for the unzip process is considered an advanced topic.*

*Note:* You can repeat this process each time that you download a set of visit files using the Workbench download tool, or simply unzip the relevant files individually by hand.
