Once the `setup.exe` file download is complete, double click the file to run the installation routine and follow the prompts to complete the process. There are no options or choices during the installation.

The software does not require Administrator privileges to install and does not place any files in the `C:\Program Files` folder. The entire application is stored in the user's profile folder.

## Obtaining Updates

The software automatically checks for newer versions every time the software is launched. When a newer version is detected the user is prompted to install it.

Note that clicking cancel turns off the automated check permanently and the software will no longer prompt when newer versions are available. 

There is also a manual "Check for Updates" feature on the Help menu in the software.
