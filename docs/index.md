The CHaMP workbench is a small, desktop piece of software indented to support analyses related to the [Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program](http://champmonitoring.org). The software comes with a database that tracks all visits to CHaMP fish monitoring sites and enables the user to organize the related CHaMP data on their computer. The main value of the workbench is queueing and batch processing various CHaMP-related models. It also makes organizing and navigating CHaMP data - both tabular information (watersheds, sites, visits, measurements and metrics) as well as the associated files (GIS layers etc).

You can obtain the free CHaMP Workbench software and database from the [download page](download.html) on this site. It is strongly recommended that you read and follow the [Getting Started](getting_started.html) instructions.
