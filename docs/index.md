The CHaMP workbench is a small, desktop piece of software indented to support analyses related to the [Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program](http://champmonitoring.org). The software comes with a database that tracks all visits to CHaMP fish monitoring sites and enables the user to organize the related CHaMP data on their computer. The main value of the workbench is queueing and batch processing various CHaMP-related models such as the **River Bathymetry Toolkit**, [Geomorphic Change Detection](http://gcd.joewheaton.org) and [Habitat Suitability Index](http://habitat.northarrowresearch.com).
